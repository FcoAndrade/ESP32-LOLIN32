# ESP32-LOLIN32
LOLIN32 WiFi Bluetooth ESP32 ESP-32 CH340G MicroPython Lithium Battery Interface


ESP32 module integrated with a Lithium Battery Interface.

ESP32 is already integrated antenna and RF balun, power amplifier, low-noise amplifiers, filters, and power management module. The entire solution takes up the least amount of printed circuit board area. This board is used with 2.4 GHz dual-mode Wi-Fi and Bluetooth chips by TSMC 40nm low power technology, power and RF properties best, which is safe, reliable, and scalable to a variety of applications.
